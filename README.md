# ZipBird: Zip Through Life, Free as a Bird

There are many different kinds of rideshare transportation nowadays: bikes, scooters, cars, hoverboards, segues...the list goes on. Although many people have adopted rideshare transportation into their everyday lives, we notcied there are many people who are still relectant to take advantage of these, mainly because of the sheer amount of information they have to process in order to effectively use these technologies. There are many different companies with different pricing and availability options that it would take forever for consumers to go through all this information and determine their best option. And so, we created out app, ZipBird in order to centralize this information. We focused mainly on scooters and bikes because existing apps already centralize car rideshare information from companies like Uber and Lyft.


First, you input your start and final destination and the app will show the nearby rideshare options avilable:

Then, after you select the mode of transporation, the app will give an estimated time of arrival and estimated cost:

After the selection is confirmed, the final route will de drawn onto the map:

We made this app using Android Studios. We used Google Maps APIs to not only generate the map that is drawn on-screen, but also to calculate estimated time of arrival, estimated cost, and to generate different routes. We made several API calls to gather information about different rideshare transporations.
